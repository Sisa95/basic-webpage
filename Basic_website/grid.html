                <p>Paris is known as a city of Romance and every couple worth their salt will 
                    make a trip to the city of love at some point. With a history steeped in romanticism, the city permeates love through its very pores, and there’s little wonder it's cited as the world’s most romantic city. From proposals under the looming Eiffel Tower
                    It is filled with an abundance of landmarks, 
                    museums and cathedrals to visit, from the iconic Eiffel Tower, 
                    to the gothic Notre Dame to the Louvre and gardens galore, few places do 
                    landmarks quite so well as the city of love.
